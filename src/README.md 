Advanced Family Tree JavaFX Application
Overview

The Advanced Family Tree project is a JavaFX-based interactive application that allows users to visualize, navigate, and manage a large multi-generation family tree. The application supports zooming, panning, threaded rendering for smooth performance, and animated path highlighting when searching for a family member.

This project demonstrates the integration of JavaFX GUI, multithreading, serialization, and tree data structures in a real-world scenario.

Features

Large Tree Visualization: Supports multiple generations with clear node layout.

Interactive Zoom & Pan: Navigate large trees easily using mouse wheel and drag.

Animated Path Highlighting: Search a family member and see their ancestry path glow sequentially.

Search & Highlight: Quickly locate and highlight a member by name.

Node Coloring by Gender: Males are displayed in light blue circles, females in pink rectangles.

Tree Traversals: Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder traversal displayed in a TextArea.

Save & Load: Serialize the tree to a file and load it back.

Threaded GUI Updates: All rendering and heavy computations run in background threads to keep the UI smooth.

Installation & Setup

Requirements:

Java 17+ (JavaFX SDK compatible)

IDE: IntelliJ, Eclipse, or VS Code

JavaFX SDK installed and properly configured

Clone or Download Project:

git clone <repository-url>


Or download as ZIP and extract.

Project Structure:

src/
├─ MainFX.java          // Entry point of the application
├─ FamilyTreePane.java  // Custom pane for rendering the tree
├─ FamilyTree.java      // Family tree logic and traversals
├─ person.java          // Node structure
└─ FileHandler.java     // Save/load serialization


Run the Application:

Ensure JavaFX SDK is added to module path.

Compile and run MainFX.java.

Example command-line run (Mac/Windows):

javac --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml src/*.java
java --module-path /path/to/javafx/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -cp src MainFX

Usage

Search Member:

Enter a name in the search box and click Search & Highlight.

The path from root to the member will glow sequentially.

Clear Highlight:

Click Clear Highlight to remove the current highlight.

Tree Traversals:

Click Preorder, Inorder, or Postorder to view traversal results in the output panel.

Save & Load:

Click Save Default to save the current tree to familytree.ser.

Click Load Default to load the previously saved tree.

Navigate Tree:

Zoom: Use mouse scroll.

Pan: Click and drag anywhere on the tree panel.

Node Design
Gender	Shape	Color
Male	Circle	Light Blue
Female	Rectangle	Pink

Highlighted Node: Red stroke.

Animated Path: Orange glow.

Key Technical Details

JavaFX Pane: Custom FamilyTreePane handles all node drawing, lines, and text.

Threaded Rendering: Background threads ensure smooth updates for large trees.

Serialization: FileHandler uses ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream.

Scalable Layout: Recursive algorithm calculates subtree widths for proper spacing.

Animations: FillTransition used for animated path highlighting.

Example Large Tree

Generations: 4

Nodes: 30+

Structure:

GreatGrandfather
  ├─ Grandfather1
  │    ├─ Father1
  │    │    ├─ Me
  │    │    └─ Sister
  │    └─ Aunt1
  └─ Grandfather2
       ├─ Uncle1
       └─ Aunt2


Children of Me, Sister, Cousin1 etc. are also added for depth.

Future Enhancements

Drag-and-drop node editing

Adding photos or avatars to nodes

Export tree as image or PDF

Dynamic node insertion/removal at runtime
